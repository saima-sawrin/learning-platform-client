          <Accordion.Body>
          When a server has been configured correctly to allow cross-origin resource sharing, some special headers will be included. Their presence can be used to determine that a request supports CORS. Web browsers can use these headers to determine whether or not an XMLHttpRequest call should continue or fail.
